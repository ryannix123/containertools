A container is a great way to run essential cloud tools such as `kubectl`, openshift-cli (`oc`), `ansible-playbook`s, `git`, `wget`, `argocd`, `argocd-autopilot`, AWS's cli (`aws`), Azure's CLI (`az`), `wget`, `rsync`, `tar`, `gzip`, `vim`, and `ssh`.

The container is built from CentOS Stream 9 and includes EPEL.

You can find the prebuilt containers at my [Quay container repo] (https://quay.io/repository/ryan_nix/containertools).
There are tags for x86 and ARM CPUs.

Here are [Containerfiles](https://github.com/ryannix123/containertools) if you would like to fork or improve it.
